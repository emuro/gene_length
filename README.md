### Data: the annotations were downloaded from public repositories

#### Proteins
The [reference proteomes](https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/?query=*&fil=reference%3Ayes) were downloaded from the Universal Protein Resource ([Uniprot](https://www.uniprot.org/)). Each proteome has a unique Uniprot-identifier (UPID). A [description](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/reference_proteomes/README) of the proteomes is also provided. It contains a table with information on every proteome: UPIDs, taxonomy_ids, species names, etc. All the reference proteomes were downloaded from [Uniprot FTP repository](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/reference_proteomes/) on 28.5.2021. Note that viruses were not downloaded and that Uniprot is updated regularly, every eight weeks.  

Then, for each species a fasta file containing its reference proteome was downloaded, preserving the directory structure of the repository. For instance, for _Homo sapiens_ (UPID: UP000005640 and taxonomy id:9606): 
```
UP000005640_9606.fasta.gz @
our_mnt_dir + /data/compressed/ + "ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/reference_proteomes/Eukaryota/UP000005640/"
```
our_mnt_dir is the local directory where the data were downloaded.

#### Protein coding genes 
The protein coding gene annotations were obtained from different webservers provided by Ensembl: [prokaryotes (Archaea, Bacteria)](https://bacteria.ensembl.org), [protists](https://protists.ensembl.org), [plants](https://plants.ensembl.org), [Fungi](http://fungi.ensembl.org/), [invertebrates](https://metazoa.ensembl.org), [vertebrates](https://ensembl.org/index.html). Any paraphyletic categorization in groups of organisms is already well established by Ensembl.

| [vertebrates (Vertebrata)](https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/)                      | ensembl 98         |  

The gzip compressed *.gtf.gz (General Transfer Format) gene annotation files were downloaded for the different species preserving the structure of the directories (FTP Ensembl repositories). For instance, for _Homo sapiens_: 
```
Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.98.gtf.gz @
our_mnt_dir + data/compressed/ + "ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-98/gtf/homo_sapiens/"
```
our_mnt_dir is, as above, the local directory where all the data were downloaded.

##### Taxonomy ids of the different species annotated in Ensembl
The taxonomy id of each species has been downloaded from the corresponding release from Ensembl for each division: [Archaea, Bacteria](http://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/bacteria/release-49/species_EnsemblBacteria.txt), [protists](http://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/protists/release-49/species_EnsemblProtists.txt), [plants](http://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/plants/release-49/species_EnsemblPlants.txt), [Fungi](http://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/fungi/release-49/species_EnsemblFungi.txt), [invertebrates](http://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/metazoa/release-49/species_EnsemblMetazoa.txt), [vertebrates](https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-98/species_EnsemblVertebrates.txt).  

##### Genome quality
The data from [NCBI genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/) was downloaded (20.6.2022) directly from [NCBI genome reports](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GENOME_REPORTS/).
