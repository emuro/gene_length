## The emergence of eukaryotes signaled by a critical protein-to-gene length ratio  

This a repository that contains the code needed to reproduce the results reported in our article; we start explaining how to obtain the data necessary to produce those results.

### The data has been downloaded from the next repositories:
The protein coding gene annotations were obtained from Ensembl for [vertebrates](https://www.ensembl.org), 
[metazoa](https://metazoa.ensembl.org), [plants](https://plants.ensembl.org), [fungi](https://fungi.ensembl.org), [protists](https://protists.ensembl.org), and [prokaryotes (archaea, bacteria)](https://bacteria.ensembl.org):
